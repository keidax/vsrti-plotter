# vsrti-plotter #

This is a application for helping teach interferometry.

More information and instructions can be found [here][project_homepage].

The code is pretty messy and there's a lot of duplication, so the first task is cleaning things up.

##TODO##

- cleanup
- lotsa bug fixes
- ability to overlay multiple data sets
