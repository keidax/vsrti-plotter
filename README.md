# vsrti-plotter #

This is a application for helping teach interferometry.

More information and instructions can be found [here][project_homepage].

The code is a pretty messy and there's a lot of duplication, so the first task is cleaning things up.

##TODO##

- cleanup
- ability to overlay multiple data sets
- re-organizing UI so buttons are not hidden on start-up
- lotsa bug fixes
